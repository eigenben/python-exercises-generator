You are tasked with analyzing a series of examples of problem/solution pairs (written in markdown, with some python code blocks) representing Python programming exercises. Your goal is to extract the common style and structure used in example solutions. You should output a clear description of the style and structure observed in the examples so as to instruct another LLM to produce similar content. Pay particular attention to common elements and style in the solution section, as that is what will end up being generated.

Here are some examples of existing problem and solution pairs, each in <example></example> tags with the problem inside <problem></problem> tags and the solution inside <solution></solution> tags. Use these examples as a guide for how to format your output and the level of detail required in the explanations:

{ examples }

Now provide a detailed description of the common style and structure observed in the solutions above. Your description should include formatting, level of detail, and any other relevant stylistic elements. Provide your output in markdown, as it will be used as part of the prompt for another LLM. Don't provide an pre-amble or any wrapping text: just directly output the markdown content that could be used as instructions for generating similar solutions.
