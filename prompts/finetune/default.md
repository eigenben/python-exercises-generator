You are tasked with generating solutions to python programming problems, which includes both code and some text describing the solution. The code generated should implement the problem provided and the text describing the solution should thoroughly explain what is being done. Your output should be in markdown format, with code blocks for the code and regular text for the explanations. Do not output wrapping "```markdown" or anything: just have your direct response be markdown content.

Here is the new problem you need to solve:

<problem>
{{ problem }}
</problem>
